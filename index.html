I promise......
Oh love of mine,
My eyes are searching for you
So that,
I could promise you…
That I’d be there
Whenever you need me
I’d care,
Either you’d care or not care.

I apologize,
Because I may not give you stars and moon.
But I’d ensure,
That I’d give my shoulders,
To soak your tears….
When you’d want to share
I’d be there with my ears

I may not be able to dive into the ocean,
To get precious gems for you.
But I’d lie down,
When you need to walk in the path of thorns.

I’ll show the stars and say,
You’re giving hard times to the stars,
As you shine more…..
You’re giving jealousy to the moon,
As she has scars in her…

You sometimes make the sun cry,
Because you are warmer,
You sometimes make breeze stop,
Because you’re cooler…..
Whenever I find myself
Alone and sad
You come and ask
You're the number one
who makes me glad

So dearest love of mine
I promise,
That I’d be with you
Forever and ever…
Till my eyes get closed
And I sleep in the bed of afterlife…….

I am marching ahead,
Not looking back now,
Stepping away
From your presence.

You were kind at times,
But your hurt ran deeper.
You offered favors sometimes,
But gave me more tears.

It was never easy
To watch you ignore me.
Each night I cried alone
While you never looked back.

The last night we met,
I came home in silence,
Hid my tears beneath a smile—
But my soul could not hide.

Moments with you
Lifted me to the seventh heaven,
But more often
I walked through hell,
Punished for sins
I never committed.

And now—
I choose freedom.
I choose light.
I march ahead,
Leaving your shadow behind.

                <p>
<strong>Date: Monday, August 25, 2025</strong>

How deep is greed?
I am greedy, and so are you.
I crave an end to this pain,
while you crave the curtain never to fall.

But our greed wears different faces.
Mine begs for healing,
yours hungers for thrill.
And still—
at the end,
we are both greedy.

Yet, the things we reach for diverge.
I long to erase the day I met you,
to strip it from memory,
to tear it from time itself.
You, instead, seek fire—
the spice of chaos in your life,
even as it scorches mine.

It wounds me to see
how your desire towers above mine.
I’ve done things I should not have.
Tell me—
do you carry the same burden?

Or do you smile in silence,
nourished by the ruin you leave behind?
If greed is a hunger,
then yours devours without end,
while mine starves,
aching only to be free.

                <summary>Office Day With You</summary>
                <p>
<strong>Date: Friday, December 5, 2014</strong>

Icy winter
And a chilling workplace there
One side table awaits you
And the other looks for me

Every half of 9
When my cell rings from yours
A hello goes with smile
From this heart to your ears

That purple fake I don't see
Your curls are still beautiful
Still u are so perfect
That every angel wants to be

Dine appears delightful
When we stroll side by side
Each time I see u
I feel my hours will go alright

Days seems to bless
When I see you are nearby me
Every beat of heart prays
To make this forever

Just you and me
                </p>
