            <details><summary>Ode to My Grandfather</summary><p>
Date: Tuesday, September 23, 2025

<p>The earliest I remember you,
Lines of time on your face,
Walking miles, carrying us all,
A quiet strength, our Ironman.

You shone like a star,
Not just to us,
But to everyone who knew you.
Simple in choices,
Boundless in heart.


I could not cry when you left,
Hard to believe even you have an end.
Now, returning home,
I wish I could see you,
Say the words I left unspoken,
Hold the moments I let slip away.</p></details>


            <details><summary>Moving On</summary><p>
 Date: Monday, September 1, 2025

I am marching ahead,
Not looking back now,
Stepping away
From your presence.

You were kind at times,
But your hurt ran deeper.
You offered favors sometimes,
But gave me more tears.

It was never easy
To watch you ignore me.
Each night I cried alone
While you never looked back.

The last night we met,
I came home in silence,
Hid my tears beneath a smile—
But my soul could not hide.

Moments with you
Lifted me to the seventh heaven,
But more often
I walked through hell,
Punished for sins
I never committed.

And now—
I choose freedom.
I choose light.
I march ahead,
Leaving your shadow behind.
</p></details>


            <details><summary>I Wish</summary><p>
 Date: Monday, August 25, 2025

I wish I could see people
The way their thoughts unfold,
I wish I could sense
The coldness they carry in silence.

I wish I could glimpse their hidden eye—
The one that judges every word,
Every step,
Every breath.

I wish I could see the demon
That hides behind their smiles,
The curse that lingers
Beneath their praise.

I wish I could unravel
Their selfish disguises—
Even when they give,
They take,
Stealing pieces of joy
You didn’t know could be stolen.

I wish I could learn
How they sell you guilt
Despite your innocence,
How they stand unshaken
While you break in secret.

I wish I could ask them—
When the tears fall in silence,
When the pain hides in shadows,
Do they even see?
Do they even care?

And still,
I wish…</p></details>


            <details><summary>Greed</summary><p>
Date: Monday, August 25, 2025

How deep is greed?
I am greedy, and so are you.
I crave an end to this pain,
while you crave the curtain never to fall.

But our greed wears different faces.
Mine begs for healing,
yours hungers for thrill.
And still—
at the end,
we are both greedy.

Yet, the things we reach for diverge.
I long to erase the day I met you,
to strip it from memory,
to tear it from time itself.
You, instead, seek fire—
the spice of chaos in your life,
even as it scorches mine.

It wounds me to see
how your desire towers above mine.
I’ve done things I should not have.
Tell me—
do you carry the same burden?

Or do you smile in silence,
nourished by the ruin you leave behind?
If greed is a hunger,
then yours devours without end,
while mine starves,
aching only to be free. </p></details>


            <details><summary>Despair</summary><p>
Date: Saturday, August 16, 2025

 After a long, silent interval.
A few droplets of joy —
Like wonderful raindrops —
Fall on my soul.

O world,
I feel heard.
I feel understood.
I cry in happiness.

Days go by...
I don’t feel alone anymore.
Everywhere,
Joy is dancing.

But then —
A thunder cracks.
All of a sudden,
Out of nowhere,
A lightning bolt
Hits me hard.

I look at myself.
Everything’s gone.
Again.
I’m back to zero.
Back to being
Nothing.

Am I heard again?
No... I’m not.
Do I try again?
I don’t know.
Do I hope again?
I don’t know.

I wish —
I wish someone told me.
Someone I could rely on.
Someone I could trust.
Someone who doesn’t judge.
A true friend.

But that,
It seems,
Is IMPOSSIBLE </p></details>

                <summary>Habits Die Hard</summary>
                <p>
 Date: Monday, November 10, 2025

Habits die hard—
not for everyone, though.
Some nurture, watch growth,
then pluck the root and move on.

Others are built differently.
They do not dismantle.
They see it bloom,
embrace it for a while.

Then one moment—
the flower wilts.
Panic sets in.
They water it,
pour a little more,
only to watch it fade.
Helplessness settles in.

            <details><summary>Destination Nowhere</summary><p>
Date; Friday, August 8, 2025

The load is heavy,

and pushing is hard.
I stand in the middle of nowhere
with no destination in sight.

A wall rises before me—
my energy drained,
my breath caught
between anxiety
and quiet devastation.

I feel poor,
not only in coin
but in the wealth of companionship.
The joy I crave
sits behind glass,
tagged with a price
I cannot pay.
I press my face to the window,
empty pockets in my hands,
knowing no one trusts me enough
to lend the currency of hope.

Each day is a battle.
Sometimes I win—
but the war feels endless,
and in the silence after,
I wonder if I am losing.

Alone,
I drift through this war-torn heart,
waiting for a reason
to keep marching.</p></details>

            <details><summary>I'm Not The One</summary><p>
Date: Thursday, july 31, 2025

I am like water—
No matter the vessel you bring,
I’ll shape myself within it.
But still, I’m never the thing
You call essential.

I am the peel—
Guarding the fruit from dirt and decay,
Yet, in the end, discarded,
Thrown away.

I am not silk—
Not rare, not prized.
My existence is a cocoon
That the butterfly forgets—
Though I helped it rise.

I am someone, but never the one.
No matter how I try, no matter how I cry,
I cannot be the voice
That draws listening ears—
A voice that explains,
That expresses,
That’s heard.

 Date: Saturday, September 22, 2018

Every new step i take
I make a mark
That soul of mine
Hollow and dark

I think evil
As i am the devil
That lucifer i am
Who grew up in hell
Hugged that underworld
And made it my own

Laughs and joy
They go away
Leaving the dark behind
Attach and detach
Does it matter
Oh! I am far from that kind

Life moves on
I look at its step
I see a darkness there too
Also i try to take a glance
At its destiny
Another darkness
Beneath the death i feel

Thereafter
I feel no one
Aimless and identityless</p></details>

 Date: Sunday, December 3, 2017 

a new plalce to begin
a new birth i call it
a beginning to be a man
a birth to shadow the pathwauly
of destiny i say
life i envison is full of bars
my trail is full of spikes
all the distractions leading me nowhere
making me sense nothing but
a complete fail
no had never been a response
but this day i want to say no
i know it is a hard-hitting thing
a kaalkut to sip
i see this will injure me
i cannot swallow either
it has trapped in my throat
so, i am learning to be mighty
that divine nilakantha
i pursue a peace
a high dose of trip to keep myself still
but then i get loud around
thus, i prefer something solid
like a tandav dance i state
hard but holy
and full of life...
as life is beautiful </p></details>

            <details><summary>Innocence</summary><p>
 Date: Monday, August 28, 2017


What I do
is just fight.
With myself
A sad me...
Broken pieces of heart...
What I do is
Try,
To stop
From dreaming
To be innocent
Like a bird!
Innocent one…
Moving my eyes away
Raise my lips high
A little bit...
And speak
That I am not guilty

What I do,
Is battle.
A battle within
That hides the limitation within
And those bullets
Stuck are not from my gun

As I go numb
I want to Roar
Like a lion king
Till every nook of the forest
Hear my song…
That heavy metal
Welcoming that state of mind
Where I scream

Innocence!!</p></details>

	<summary> Stronger than Ever </summary>

	<p>
	There are bad days,
And there are worse ones too.
But today hit hard.
You’ll remember this someday —
Maybe even laugh a little…
But that’s for tomorrow.</p>

<p>The problems rose,
All the way up that hill.
It’s hard to climb,
But hey — it’s you.
You will.
You’ve got that will.</p>

<p>The frustration,
The sickness, the uncertainty —
Everything hitting at once.
But you’re the commander.
You’ve taken arrows, swords, and cuts,
And still kept going.
That’s how strong your will is.</p>

<p>Like a chatbot,
I text you—
you reply,
maybe late, but always.
I ask questions,
you answer.
I like the company…
the way I once liked AI
in the early days.
It felt human,
felt heartful.</p>

<p>But the longer I stayed,
the more wrong it felt.
Today feels more wrong
than yesterday.</p>

<p>Now all you sound is courtesy—
a coded machine
giving default replies.
Okay… maybe a little more than default,
but still,
the feeling I get nowadays
is all AI.</p>


<p>Yet I’m human.
I don’t let go that easily—
not of family,
not of friends,
not even of AI.</p>

  <summary>Unspoken</summary>
  <p>Date: Friday, June 6, 2014</p>

  <p>
It’s tough my dear
When I can’t
Express the feel
That drifts every single second
When you’re nearby
When it’s your name
In my thoughts
And when my heart
Thumps faster
Oh my fragrant sugar
Sometimes it’s envious
That I sense
When one and all
Embrace their sweetheart
But not me
Also feel shoddier
When I see
That your love,
Is not for me
It slays me,
When I have to slaughter
Every single expression
And the phrases of love
That arise 
On my heart and soul
But are left quiet and unspoken
  </p>

  <p>
I have verses in a million
And I would express an oath
But it’s tough
When I am the lone one
To fancy about holding
That hand of love
Commitment and
Enduring attachment
Up until the final sleep
  </p>
