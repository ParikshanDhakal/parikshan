I promise......
Oh love of mine,
My eyes are searching for you
So that,
I could promise you…
That I’d be there
Whenever you need me
I’d care,
Either you’d care or not care.

I apologize,
Because I may not give you stars and moon.
But I’d ensure,
That I’d give my shoulders,
To soak your tears….
When you’d want to share
I’d be there with my ears

I may not be able to dive into the ocean,
To get precious gems for you.
But I’d lie down,
When you need to walk in the path of thorns.

I’ll show the stars and say,
You’re giving hard times to the stars,
As you shine more…..
You’re giving jealousy to the moon,
As she has scars in her…

You sometimes make the sun cry,
Because you are warmer,
You sometimes make breeze stop,
Because you’re cooler…..
Whenever I find myself
Alone and sad
You come and ask
You're the number one
who makes me glad

So dearest love of mine
I promise,
That I’d be with you
Forever and ever…
Till my eyes get closed
And I sleep in the bed of afterlife…….

I have been treated like a fool,
Treated mean and cruel
My faithful heart was broken,
And torn all apart.

But it all ended
And came a sunshine
Who holds me tight
And tells everything’s fine.

Every night I prayed to the stars,
In the noon I prayed the sun
I even worshipped clouds and the moon
And wondered…where the mighty god is hidden.

When I saw the smile of yours,
Light as air became my heart.
The tears of joy rolled down.
Oh! What a moment it was.

My need of god was over
As so angelicious are you.
My fate of emptiness is over
As so precious are you.

The time has come when,
I can see the smile of yours
Talk about how great are you
Utter the words of appreciations
Thank you for the smiley art you drew
Which took my sorrows apart….
And took me top in the chart
Of the graph of joy………..</p></details>

<p>
Date: Thursday, June 5, 2014

 A slight conversation
With you my beloved one.
Drives me to bliss
As well as anxious and alarmed.
But, still I feel
To talk,
A minute more
And another minute more after that minute.
An entire daylight
Spent nearby you
Still is not
Ever enough.
And my soul
Wants more
To grasp your sight
And talk to you
A minute more
And another minute more after that minute.</p></details>

<p>
 Date: Monday, June 9, 2014

That beauty
In red and white
Gorgeous As ever
And I fell for her
Once more
Offered my heart  
All again

It senses something distinctive
And I look around
It’s that beauty again
In red and white
Looking at me and smiling
In my dreams and my fantasy

Though shattered into pieces
I managed to offer
My heart
Thus I see her
In red and white
Every moment
And every second
In my dreams

That beauty
In red and white
With remarkable loveliness
Time and again 
Goosebump me
When I try to recall her
That beauty
In red and white
Makes me fall in love
Again and again
That beauty

In red and white</p></details>

<p>
Date: Friday, December 5, 2014

Icy winter
And a chilling workplace there
One side table awaits you
And the other looks for me

Every half of 9
When my cell rings from yours
A hello goes with smile
From this heart to your ears

That purple fake I don't see
Your curls are still beautiful
Still u are so perfect
That every angel wants to be

Dine appears delightful
When we stroll side by side
Each time I see u
I feel my hours will go alright

Days seems to bless
When I see you are nearby me
Every beat of heart prays
To make this forever

Just you and me</p></details>

A bright summer morning,
Colorful skies —
Those rainbows of dreams.
The whole world feels brighter
Whenever I see you smile.

The wind moves through me,
A dream come true
Whenever you’re near.
That feeling when I hold your hand —
Not even the stars compare to it.
That feeling when I pull you close —
Not even the stars compare to this.

A handful of joy,
Yet now I hold so much more
As long as you’re by my side.
When I open my eyes,
You’re the first one I see;
Before I close them,
You’re the last.

I wait for that bright morning
When you’re beside me,
Again and forever.
Through thick and thin,
We walk together
All our lives —
Till death do us part.</p></details>

You, a faith
An inspirer and a dreamer
A company that I,
Would always strive for
A folk that I
Would at all times
Want around
To raise the glare
Of hope
Ignite up my spirit
And to lessen my affliction
That scuffles as my counter
To cease me,
Leave me alone
Dejected and dispirited
Emotionally and spiritually
You, a shining star
Which I always hope to see
To wish and to accomplish
The urge and the need
Concealed in a secret,
Within myself,
In to the core

You, a comrade,
A good friend
That I,
Will always want
To empty
My entire sentiment
With some pains and some gains
With some tears and some fears
Sometimes a lemon and sometimes cream</p></details>

<p>When stars are hidden
In those dark clouds
When the little droplets of rain
Breaks down in my face,
I miss you,
I recall my days,
Those past days
Where we were holding
Each other’s back
Where we were those free birds
Of same pack…
I miss those days
Where you and I used to roam
In the sky of charm, freedom
And friendship
I miss those days
Where you cared me,
You made me feel special…
Even if I did not have anything
So special…
When those rain drops
Break down into many
I remember how we
Got apart
And miss you
Every time when
First week of august comes
When I get victory
When no one care about my identity…
Or when I feel pity
On myself…
You are the person
Who comes first in my mind
And say everything is better
A new way to happiness
You’ll find…
