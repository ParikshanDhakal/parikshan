                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I'm Parikshan Dhakal, a passionate poet who loves exploring emotions, life experiences, and small moments that inspire creativity.</p>

                    <p>I’ve enjoyed writing poetry since I was ten. Anything that struck me deeply became a topic, and the feelings that followed always seemed to find their own words. As adolescence came, the emotions grew stronger and the words grew rawer. I’ve never tried to force my poems to rhyme; instead, I try my best to translate my emotions exactly as I feel them. Maybe that’s why my lines don’t follow typical poetic patterns—they follow my heart instead.</p>

<p>There are moments in daily life that cling to us. Some warm us with joy, while others leave us hollow and dry. For me, the way I feel—and the way people make me feel—becomes the core inspiration behind my writing. I’m an emotional person, easily touched by small acts and gestures, and I like to think of myself as a kind-hearted person. Perhaps that’s why I write: it is my most genuine form of expression. I see my poems as feelings safely documented. When I reread them, I remember what happened, what I felt, and who I was at that moment. It lets me revisit a little bit of the past—not always, but just enough to understand myself better.</p>

<p>After moving to America in 2023, everything felt new. Some of it was exciting; some of it was overwhelming. People carried themselves differently, and the world felt unfamiliar compared to where I came from. That difference became another reason to write. My poetry became a bridge between the life I left behind and the life I was learning to live.</p>

<p>Alongside my love for writing, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I am passionate about learning how technology works, and my goal is to build a meaningful career in the IT field. While I dedicate myself to studies and professional growth, I also remain committed to writing poetry—it continues to be a way for me to express emotions, reflect on life, and preserve moments that might otherwise fade. Balancing technology and creativity is important to me; both are parts of who I am.</p>

<p>In every aspect of my life, I strive to combine curiosity, empathy, and dedication. Whether in my studies, my career ambitions, or my writing, I aim to approach each challenge with heart and intention. Poetry allows me to capture the human experience, while IT gives me the tools to create, solve, and contribute in a practical way. Together, they reflect my identity: a thoughtful, kind-hearted individual navigating the world with both logic and feeling.</p>
